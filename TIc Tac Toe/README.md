The Tic Tac Toe App is a web-based game that allows users to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game against a opponent. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, and players take turns marking their symbol (X or O) in an attempt to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game provides a user-friendly interface that displays the current state of the game, including the board, player turns, and game status (win, draw, or ongoing). It also includes features such as a reset button to start a new game.
